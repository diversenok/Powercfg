## Powercfg-Requests

This is a demo project on how to retrieve a list of currently active power requests on the system. Programs (such as media players) can create power request by using the [PowerCreateRequest](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-powercreaterequest) function, followed by calls to [PowerSetRequest](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-powersetrequest). It allows them to request the system to ignore its default settings of dimming the display or shutting down after a timeout of inactivity. The built-in **powercfg** tool allows viewing such requests when called with a `/requests` parameter. Under the hood, it uses [NtPowerInformation](https://github.com/processhacker/processhacker/blob/afda2a2dbf2d2e37abc0e3986c295ec279192eb4/phnt/include/ntpoapi.h#L244-L253) with undocumented info class `GetPowerRequestList`. The purpose of this project is to reverse and document the underlying structures.
